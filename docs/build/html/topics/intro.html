<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There is a notion in Systems Administration that services are better when they
can be treated as Cattle, rather than Pets. That is to say, when cattle gets
badly injured its owner will typically have it slaughtered and replace it with
a new animal, but when a pet gets badly injured its owner will typically do
everything within reason to nurse the animal back to health. We want services
to be easily replaceable, and when a service begins to fail healthcecks we want
to discard it and replace it with a healthy instance.</p>
<p>For a service to be treated as cattle, it typically has the following
properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It can be load-balanced, and any instance can serve any request as well as
any other instance.</li>
<li>It has simple health checks that can indicate when an instance should be
removed from the load balancer pool.</li>
<li>When a new instance is started it does not start serving requests until it
is healthy.</li>
<li>When a new instance is started it reaches a healthy state quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, existing Ethereum nodes don’t fit well into this model:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Certain API calls are stateful, meaning the same instance must serve multiple
successive requests and cannot be transparently replaced.</li>
<li>There are numerous ways in which an Ethereum node can be unhealthy, some of
which are difficult to determine.<ul>
<li>A node might be unhealthy because it does not have any peers</li>
<li>A node might have peers, but still not receive new blocks</li>
<li>A node might be starting up, and have yet to reach a healthy state</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a new instance is started it generally starts serving on RPC
immediately, even though it has yet to sync the blockchain. If the load
balancer serves request to this instance it will serve outdated information.</li>
<li>When new instances are started, they must discover peers, download and
validate blocks, and update the state trie. This takes hours under the best
circumstances, and days under extenuating circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result it is often easier to spend time troubleshooting the problems on a
particular instance and get that instance healthy again, rather than replace it
with a fresh instance.</p>
<p>The goal of this initiative is to create enhanced open source tooling that will
enable DApp developers to treat their Ethereum nodes as replaceable cattle
rather than indespensable pets.</p>
